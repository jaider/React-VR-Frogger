# :frog: Frogger-React-VR

## [Play the game!](https://t.co/pNtr9QDfaZ)

This is a proof-of-concept project and a recreation of Frogger using [React VR](https://facebook.github.io/react-vr/).

## How to Play

Use W, A, S, D keys on desktop to move around. On mobile, your character moves in the direction of the part of the screen you tap in. If you tap the top part of your screen, the frog will move forward. Tapping left moves the frog left, and so forth.

## Installation

Download the project. Run `yarn` in the project directory. Run `yarn start` to run the app in development mode. Navigate to `localhost:8081/vr/` in your browser to see it in action.

Alternatively, access the development server from your phone by opening `192.168.1.100:8081/vr/index.html` if your local IP is `192.168.1.100`. If you are running this project on a Mac or Linux machine and do not know your local IP, you can run `ifconfig` in your terminal. Look for an IP that matches `192.169.1.*`.
